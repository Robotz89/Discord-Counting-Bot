# Discord-Counting-Bot
This discord bot allows you to add your token, along with a few other IDs that you need from your server, and make a fully functional counting bot! The reason this is helpful is that other counting bots that are public don't work or are constantly going down. This fixes that, and you can even follow the instructions to set up a web server for it, so it never goes down either! If you do take it down though, the count will be saved.
